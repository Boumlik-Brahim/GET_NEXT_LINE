# get_next_line

The get_next_line project is a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, one line at a time, and returns that line as a string. In this project, you will write a function that can read from a file or standard input and return the next line of text.

# Usage:

To use the function in your code, you must include the get_next_line.h header file:

`#include "get_next_line.h"`

You can then call the get_next_line function with a file descriptor and a pointer to a string:

`int	get_next_line(int fd, char **line);`

# Functionality:

The get_next_line function reads a line from a file descriptor and returns that line as a string. It can read from a file or from standard input. The function reads one line at a time, and returns that line as a string.

The function also some edge cases to handle, such as if the input file contains no lines or if the input file contains a line that is too long to fit in the allocated memory.

# Conclusion:

The get_next_line project is an important project that will help you to gain a better understanding of how to read from files in C and how to allocate and deallocate memory dynamically. By completing this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to handle edge cases in your functions and how to work with file descriptors in your C programs.
